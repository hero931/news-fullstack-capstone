## Use Case

User also have some sort of interaction with app by searching news for specific date (user's birthday)! 

## Initial UX

* As a visitor, I want to be able to look for a specific date news.

* As a visitor I want to be able to type in my birthday date and see the results based on search.

* As a user I would like to read the entire article at original source.
